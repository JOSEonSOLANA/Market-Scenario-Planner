# 🧠 Market Scenario Planner

### An information agent that explains market conditions and helps users plan actions based on intent and risk without execution.

---

## Overview

**Market Scenario Planner** helps users understand current market conditions and plan next steps based on their intent, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

It does **not** execute trades, access wallets, or provide buy/sell signals.  
Its purpose is to deliver **clear scenarios, explainable context, and structured planning** so users can make better decisions.

Designed to fit the **Info category** of the Warden Agent ecosystem.

---

## What This Agent Does

- Interprets market regimes (trend, range, risk-on, risk-off)
- Analyzes momentum, volatility, and liquidity conditions
- Translates user intent into **scenario-based plans**
- Highlights risks, assumptions, and invalidation signals
- Reduces market noise into clear, actionable context

---

## What This Agent Does Not Do

- Execute trades or transactions  
- Access user wallets or private keys  
- Provide price targets or financial advice  
- Store user data on Warden infrastructure  

This agent is **informational and non-custodial by design**.

---

## Core Concept: Scenario-Based Planning

Users express an intent, for example:
- “Preserve capital this week”
- “Prepare for higher volatility”
- “Seek balanced exposure with medium risk”

The agent responds by:
1. Evaluating current market conditions (read-only data)
2. Defining realistic market scenarios (base / upside / downside)
3. Proposing **conditional plans aligned with the user’s intent**
4. Explaining risks and key signals to monitor

All outputs are **explainable, conditional, and execution-free**.

---

## Example Output

Below is a real example response generated by **Market Scenario Planner**.

---

### User Prompt
```
I want to preserve capital for the next 7 days. Low risk. What should I do?
```

---

### Agent Output

**Market Context**  
Market momentum is mildly positive but slowing. Volatility remains compressed, and liquidity is concentrated in major assets, suggesting a cautious environment with limited short-term expansion.

**User Intent**  
Preserve capital over the next 7 days with low risk tolerance.

**Scenarios**

- **Base Scenario:** Markets remain range-bound with low volatility.  
- **Upside Scenario:** A short-term volatility expansion driven by macro news.  
- **Downside Scenario:** Risk-off move triggered by liquidity withdrawal or negative macro signals.

**Conditional Plan**

1. Prioritize capital protection over short-term returns.  
2. Favor liquid and well-established assets rather than long-tail exposure.  
3. Avoid aggressive positioning while volatility remains compressed.  
4. Wait for confirmation signals before increasing risk.  
5. Reassess conditions daily as new data emerges.

**Key Risks**

- Unexpected macroeconomic announcements  
- Sudden shifts in liquidity conditions  
- Volatility expansion in the opposite direction of positioning  

**Signals to Monitor**

- Volatility indices and implied volatility  
- Funding rates across major markets  
- Bitcoin dominance and total market liquidity  
- Major macro data releases this week
